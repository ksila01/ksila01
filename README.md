#### Data Visualization/Analysis: Power BI Projects
##### Maji Ndogo National Water Survey Analysis Integrated Projects
> Maji Ndogo is a mythical city that is experiencing the challenge of accessing clean water and sanitation. Using data on water sources, collections, and challenges associated with accessing water, such as water-related crimes, I was able to gain valuable insights into the daily lives of Maji Ndogo Residents and the role that water plays in shaping their lives. The integrated project consisted of four parts, and I used Power BI in the analysis, visualizations, and reporting
#### [Part 1: Visualizing Maji Ndogo's Past](https://github.com/ksila01/Maji-Ndogo-Water-Survey-Part-1-Visualizing-Maji-Ndogo-s-Past.git)
> This project aims to highlight the water crisis in Maji Ndogo by providing a clearer picture of the situation. The visualizations illustrate the disparity between rural and urban populations, the proportion of the population relying on various water sources, and the state of infrastructure across different provinces. Additionally, it emphasizes the critical need to address gender inequality in water access.

#### [Part 2: Moulding Data Into Visual Stories of Maji Ndogo](https://github.com/ksila01/Maji-Ndogo-Water-Survey-Part-2.git)
> The next phase of the project focuses on visualizing the data to provide a comprehensive overview of the national survey results. This will involve creating visual representations for newly calculated fields, such as the average queue time per water source, classifying water sources based on access levels (e.g., basic vs. below basic), and estimating improvement costs. Additionally, it will include mapping pollution, analyzing crime data related to water access, and extracting key water-related insights

#### [Part 3: Communicating Findings in Maji Ndogo](https://github.com/ksila01/Maji_Ndogo_Part3)
>The national dashboard provided a detailed overview of the population distribution, challenges, budget requirements, current water access levels, and the costs associated with improving water sources in the Maji Ndogo region. This tool is designed to keep the public informed about ongoing efforts while enabling decision-makers to monitor and manage the project effectively.
